Ever since Ansible Collections got introduced, `ansible-galaxy
collection install` had to somehow figure the whole dependency tree that
it's supposed to download and install. The code we had rather entangled.
But things are going to change starting [ansible-core] 2.11.
And here's how.

[//]: # (PLUGIN-READ-FULL-POST)

One of the [items planned for ansible-core v2.11][ansible-core 2.11
Roadmap] was improving `ansible-galaxy collection` CLI. The first thing
needed was making possible to [upgrade collections by `install`
subcommand without requiring `--force` or
`--force-with-deps`][ansible-core issue #71784]. This is something
[people have been wanting][ansible proposal #181] for quite a while but
[wasn't possible for roles][ansible proposal #23].

Then, we also wanted to introduce an additional `ansible-galaxy
collection install [ -U | --upgrade ]` option. And we also considered
working on the new `ansible-galaxy collection remove` subcommand but
never had time to complete this stretch goal[^ansible collection rm].

[^ansible collection rm]: [The attempt to implement it](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73464) revealed that we need more design discussion to define how exactly `ansible-galaxy collection uninstall` is supposed to work.

Another thing on our radar was caching HTTP responses to Galaxy API so
that the dependency resolution process could become dramatically faster.

[Jordan], [Sloane] and I formed a feature team to work on this. We
decided that we'll try to cut the subtasks one per person to spread the
load somehow. [Jordan] was to work on caching, [Sloane] was assigned to
do the `--upgrade` task and I was supposed to work on updating the bare
`install` command to make it not require `--force` (and
`--force-with-deps` for that matter) when there's a need to update the
already installed collections.

I was almost unfamiliar with this part of [ansible-core] so I needed to
get myself familiar with it by starting with exloring the pointers of my
colleagues on what functions will likely to need updates. What could
possibly go wrong? Well, as I was going deeper and deeper down the
rabbit hole, I realized that there was a lot of complexity in the
existing code and we basically had a rather simplistic dependency
resolver that looked like a yarn of leaky abstractions. It was hard to
reason about what strategies it follows to get all the transitive
dependencies for collections requested to be installed or downloaded.
At the same time, I remembered that there is this other prominent
project in the Python ecosystem ‚Äî [pip] ‚Äî that recently got a fresh out
of the oven dependency resolver [resolvelib] It's a third-party library
that [pip] bundles but it's also freely available for use via `pip
install`. My buddy [Pradyun] has been involved with this effort (the
[pip] one) for about four years so I had somebody I could ask dumb
questions about the dependency resolution :)

And so the idea to replace the dependency resolver was born. Instead of
patching a few places in the old code here and there, I thought why
don't I ~~overengineer this task and refactor the whole thing~~ improve
the maintainability of the subpackage dedicated to managing collection
CLI subcommands!

I must say that my enthusiasm to ~~break all the things~~ refine a whole
bunch of already working code was met with a lot of suspicion within the
broader Ansible Core Engineering team, at first. This additionally meant
introducing a new runtime dependency ‚Äî something that we almost never
do. We now have a good mechanism to help OS packagers seamlessly bundle
runtime dependencies, though[^_vendor/ dir].

[^_vendor/ dir]: The downstream packagers can now just drop the external dependencies into `lib/ansible/_vendor/` transparently instead of packaging them separately, [starting ansible-base v2.10](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/69850).

I faced with a challenge ‚Äî *I knew* that the idea was good and now I had
to convince others that it's not as crazy as it may seem.

I switched into the research mode, looked into what interfaces and hooks
[resolvelib] requires and came up with a tiny 225 LoC long
[proof-of-concept][ansible-galaxy+resolvelib PoC]. I even [wired the
demo into GitHub Actions CI/CD][ansible-galaxy+resolvelib+gha] do people
see the result instantly. After that, when folks saw how easy it is to
connect [resolvelib] and delegate the resolution correctness
responsibility to it, the team agreed that this refactoring would be
useful and we should proceed.

Meanwhile [Jordan] was working on his caching task. So while I was busy
figuring out where to stick [resolvelib] into our spaghetti, [Jordan]
submitted [the API HTTP request caching PR][ansible-core PR #71904] and
it got merged without any problems.

The resolver replacement work was so fundamental that it turned out to
block virtually everything else related to our ansible-galaxy CLI UX
improvements. This was no longer just my task. Yes, I was making most of
the design for the new architecture but I got just enormous amount of
help getting this to the finish line. And I enjoyed this collaboration
so much!

It wasn't just throwing old code away and adding the new one in place.
One of our main objectives was to keep the behavior as close as possible
to what the old code did. We've identified a lot of reduntant tests that
could be removed, rewrote some of the unit tests into integration tests.
We've also identified a ton of gaps in the test coverage which we filled
in with many new tests (yaaay! üôå). [Sloane] also did a lot of manual
behavior verification and testing üëè.

### resolvelib and fancy design patterns

I mentioned earlier that [resolvelib] was easy to integrate and even
linked that extremely short PoC. This creates an illusion that it could
be a "5-minute patch" but it totally wasn't.

[resolvelib] requires one to implement an interface they call "provider"
with the following hooks:
* `identify(requirement_or_candidate)` ‚Äî returns a unique identifier for
  the package (FQCN in our case)
* `get_preference(resolution, candidates, information)` ‚Äî makes a sort
  key determining the "importance" of a certain requirement
* `find_matches(requirements)` ‚Äî returns all candidates matching the
  given requirements
* `is_satisfied_by(requirement, candidate)` ‚Äî double-checks the
  correctness of the candidates resolver chooses
* `get_dependencies(candidate)` ‚Äî retrieves all the direct requirements
  that given candidate has

This doesn't look too complicated, does it? That's because resolvelib
really doesn't care what your requirements and candidates are for as
long as you keep interfacing with it via the same data structures.

This also means that the resolver *doesn't know where to get the info
about the requirements and the candidates* beyond the data you provide
to it by implementing these hooks.

So we needed to implement talking to Galaxy API, taking into accont more
than one Galaxy-like server as a source for retrieving collections. We
needed to take into account non-Galaxy provided artifacts like direct
URLs to tarballs or Git repos, or local files and folders.

This all could easily increase the complexity so I introduced the
concepts of a concrete artifacts manager, and a facade for talking to
multiple Galaxy APIs and other metadata sources (including the artifacts
manager). The artifacts manager is responsible for downloading and
caching the artifacts (if they are not local) as well as retrieving (and
caching) their metadata. It also has an alternative constructor that can
clean up the cache directory upon exit.
Both objects are initialized once (at the beginning) and are passed to
the consumers as a dependency injection.

Most of the packaging ecosystems are rather simple. They have packages
with the content of one "atom" inside the artifact. Ansible Collections
are mostly like that but there are additional cases which make
everything substantionally more complex. One of the primary use-cases
that differ is SCM-based collections ‚Äî they may have one collection in
the root of the repository but also in a certain (user-defined)
subdirectory. Moreover, SCM targets may have multiple collections inside
the same repository (in a namespace subdir that also can be nested as
defined by the repo creators).
To solve this, we mark Git targets as "virtual collections" during the
dependency resolution. The artifacts manager downloads them into a
temporary directory and marks that directory a single dependency of such
a "virtual Git collection"). If there's subdirs, we do the same "virtual
collection" trick with them (except unpacked dirs don't need to be
copied into cache, the manager just holds their real paths in memory).
These "virtual collections" are very helpful during the resolution and
are skipped on the install step (after the resolution is complete).

### Fin.

Well, that's about it. 3‚Äì4 months into experimentation, development,
testing, polishing and reviews, days before the feature freeze, and the
feature is in devel!

Based on the refactoring, [Sloane] was able to complete her work on the
`--upgrade` option and it got merged too.

### Feedback, please üôè

If you are an end-user who uses `ansible-galaxy collection
[download|install|list|verify]` subcommands, please make sure to tell us
how well we managed to mix refactoring with the feature development this
time. Hopefully, we've squashed all the bugs already ü§û but we missed
anything ‚Äî let us know! üññ
