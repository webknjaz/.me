title: Et Tu BrutÃ¨? Use Travis CI for FOSS no more.

excerpt: 

For many years [Travis CI] has been a go-to solution for
automatically running the test suites for open source
projects hosted on GitHub. They used to provide a great
service and a lot more resources to FOSS projects compared
to their competitors. Not anymore, though. And why am I not
surprised?

So can we dump Travis CI yet? Let's see...

body:

Something sadly[^kill-FOSS-sentiment] expected has happened
at the beginning of the last week. Travis CI â€” a pioneer
in the field that brought automated testing seamlessly
integrated with GitHub to ~~masses~~ many open-source
projects on scale â€” announced that they are migrating all
of the public projects that previously got the service for
free to a trial plan with a limited amount of toy credits to
use[^anti-FOSS].

[^kill-FOSS-sentiment]: A lot of people got upset because of this [Travis CI fuckup].
[^anti-FOSS]: [Travis gave everyone 10K credits][Travis CI FOSS cut-off] and suggested that people would need to switch to a paid plan after that.

Ever since they were acquired[^sinking-idera] by a company
with a rather shady past[^shady-idera], Travis CI kept
going down this path. They've been shrinking the resources
again and again over the past few years and it seems this
sort of outcome was inevitable, expecially once they've
suddenly layed off a lot of senior engineers[^layoff-idera].

[^sinking-idera]: Travis [announced the acquisition by Idera][Travis Idera acquisition] on Jan 23, 2019.
[^shady-idera]: Some people on HN seem to have previous experience with [Idera ruining their acquired businesses][shady Idera]. Also, they've announced all sorts of commitments like keeping the [Travis Foundation] alive and now, almost two years in, that domain is dead and googling doesn't even find any mentions of it.
[^layoff-idera]: Idera [removed many essensial employees][Idera layoff] without a warning and folk on Twitter call this the [last nail] in the coffin.

Of course, they've made a rather pathetic attempt to assure
everyone that they'll continue to support open source. But
who are they kidding? I bet most of the maintainers have
better things to do then go begging support for a bunch of
free credits every now and then just to keep things runing.
Folks keep underestimating the [FOSS maintenance effort] and
it even seems like projects using [Tidelift] may be
inelligible[^travis-uncommercial-foss].

[^travis-uncommercial-foss]: It's not yet clear but people on Twitter speculate that [Tidelift-baked FOSS projects may not get free credits][Travis no credit]

### Now What?

Even before the acquisition there's been signs that Travis
CI wasn't doing well. There are a lot of articles on setting
up other CIs like [Azure Pipelines] or [GitHub Actions CI/CD
Workflows]. Most of the alternative options provide a
comparable experience but may have slightly different ways
of being set up. There are also even more powerful CIs like
[Zuul] that are available to significant FOSS projects.

[GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflows]: https://hynek.me/articles/python-github-actions/
[Zuul]: https://zuul-ci.org

### So can we dump Travis CI yet?

Yes, we totally can do that! Should we, though? I'm
personally planning to stop advocating for using Travis CI
if it's not necessary for a given project. Back in the day,
I even contributed a GitHub Pages deployment provider into
their dpl project so I feel a little nostalgic... I used to
give linting CI set up tasks to my mentees based on Travis.
But now, I don't want to advertise a FOSS-unfriendly lock-in
so I'll switch to [GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflows].

There's one case when I may need to consider using Travis CI
additionally to other systems â€” there are cases when I'd
want to run tests in environments (architectures) that none
of the other CIs provide. But this will be decided on
per-project basis.

Huh. I guess that's all I've been wanting to write. ðŸ––
