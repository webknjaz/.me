Once upon a time, I used to have a blog. I've lost it at some point.
But here I am again. Starting over... As if this time I won't have
excuses to postpone writing new posts. The [definition of insanity],
huh?

Anyway. It's now time to start over. The old blog used [WordPress] and
thus required a web-server with some software like nginx and php-fpm.
What sounded necessary back in the day seems ridiculous today.
Personal blogs don't need to generate pages on flight, or hit a
separate database. All that's needed is some static site generator.
And so I chose [Lektor] for this purpose. It's pythonic and very well
customizable â€” just what one needs to run a blog that can be published
to [GitHub Pages].

Urgh... That's a pretty long backstory so I'll stop here.

Welcome to my blog!
