### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [@webknjaz][GitHub Sponsors] and I do open source.

I have no clue how you got here but it's probably because you either know some
of my work, or somebody sent you my way. I used to have a blog roughly a decade
ago but then I stopped updating it, eventually forgot to [pay  â‚¬ for the
hosting][DO referral link], and lost it. I believe all of the backups are
busted... I can't promise to update this site regularly but it's unlikely that
a GitHub Pages hosted resource will disappear like that :)

A short summary about me:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [CPython Internals](
https://realpython.com/products/cpython-internals-book/)
  and [the basics of OpenShift](
  https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/do180-introduction-containers-kubernetes-red-hat-openshift)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on improving the Python ecosystem around
  making GitHub Apps and Actions, packaging, testing, CI/CD
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting more hours in a day
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python packaging, CI/CD, pytest, creating GitHub Apps,
  GitHub Actions, Ansible Collections, CherryPy internals,
  async in Python 3, tox, Gentoo Linux, Git, code reviews, linters,
  maintaining the compatibility with legacy Pythons, dev env, burnouts
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tweet
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: [he/him](http://pronoun.is/he)
- ðŸ”­ To find out what I'm currently working on, check out the [Stuff I do]
  page or [my GitHub profile][GitHub]
- âš¡ Fun fact: wanting to "fix" a game got me interested in computers
  when I was 7 but when I got older I lost interest in games, worked in
  gaming for just 3 months and never looked back

I don't have a specific plan for filling this blog with content but I'll probably text something techy. And when I'll be in a not so nerdy mood, I'll probably rant about some normal people's stuff too.

If you think I abandoned this site, drop by [my twitter][Twitter] to see if I'm still alive. Also, don't be surprised if something seems outdated â€” it probably is. Enjoy exploring!
